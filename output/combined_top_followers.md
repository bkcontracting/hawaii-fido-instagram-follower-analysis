**Hawaii Connection Detail**: LOCAL_STRONG - Kailua community leader with deep ties to Windward Oahu. Hawaii Autism Foundation indicates years of local nonprofit work and community building.

**Outreach Strategy**: Peer-to-peer nonprofit outreach. Connect as fellow disability-focused Hawaii nonprofit. Propose cross-promotion, shared events, or joint grant applications. Request introduction to Hawaii Autism Foundation donors and board members who may also support service dog mission. Invite to dinner as nonprofit partner.
