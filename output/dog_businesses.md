- **Network Value**: Med
- **Best Move**: In-facility flyers + client email partnership

**Why They Matter**: Dog daycare and boarding facility in Waipahu serving Central/West Oahu — a geographic market not covered by the Honolulu-based pet businesses. Their location near military installations (Schofield, Wheeler) means access to military families who often rely on service dogs.
