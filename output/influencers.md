- **Bio**: Athlete

#### Outreach Analysis
- **$$ Potential**: None
- **Network Value**: Med
- **Best Move**: DM collab request; one post = huge visibility

**Why They Matter**: Largest individual following in the entire follower base. Athlete with massive reach. No evident Hawaii/service dog/nonprofit connection, but a single post or story mention would generate enormous awareness. Pure amplification play.

**Outreach Strategy**: DM requesting a one-time collab post or story share about Hawaii Fi-Do's mission. Frame as a feel-good cause that resonates with her audience. No financial ask — the visibility is the value.

- **Bio**: Honolulu, Hawaii — Mommy's boy @sammmysaccaro — Professional rock diver
- **Source**: High Follower

#### Notes
Honolulu celebrity dog (French Bulldog) with 64K+ followers. Miscategorized as hospitality business — this is a personal pet influencer account. Excluded from Tier 1 (not a business entity). However, owner @sammmysaccaro has brand partnerships (Dr. Harvey's) and could promote Hawaii Fi-Do to an enormous, engaged pet-lover audience. Promotional value far exceeds any direct donation ask.
