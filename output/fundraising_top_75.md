## Outreach Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Government & Strategic Partnerships (Week 1-2)
- Government officials (Councilmembers, Representatives)
- Member-based organizations (Rotary Clubs, etc.)
- Major corporations with CSR programs
- **Expected**: Policy connections, board introductions, event partnerships

### Phase 2: Established Local Businesses (Week 3-4)
- Successful breweries, restaurants, service providers
- Marketing agencies and creative firms
- Service dog aligned organizations
- **Expected**: Local support, pro-bono services, community reach

### Phase 3: Pet Industry & Community (Week 5+)
- Pet groomers, trainers, veterinarians
- Pet supply stores and services
- Community organizations and events
- **Expected**: Cross-promotion, event collaboration, grassroots support

---

## Key Strategic Insights

1. **Member-Based Organizations**: These are multipliers - one connection gives you access to many affluent members. Rotary Clubs, professional associations, and churches should be top priority.

2. **Government Officials**: Low follower counts can be deceiving. Government officials are strategic doors that open networks and provide credibility.

3. **Service Dog Alignment**: Any organization or individual who works with service dogs is a natural partner with built-in mission alignment.

4. **Local Hawaii Businesses**: 42% of candidates are Hawaii-based, making them highly accessible for in-person relationships and community collaboration.

5. **Marketing Agencies**: Hawaii has marketing agencies that might provide pro-bono services beyond financial donations.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Website Research**: Visit websites for top 25 candidates to understand business capacity and community involvement
2. **Decision-Maker Identification**: Find specific contacts (owners, executives, community relations)
3. **Warm Introductions**: Identify mutual connections who can introduce Hawaii FIDO
4. **Customized Pitches**: Tailor outreach based on each organization's values and business model
5. **Track Engagement**: Monitor responses and adjust strategy based on early results
