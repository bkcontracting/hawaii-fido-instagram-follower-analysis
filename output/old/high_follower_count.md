# Hawaii Fi-Do High Follower Count — Audience Size Leaders

> Top 12 accounts by follower count among all @hawaiifido followers regardless of category
> Goal: Visibility into the largest audiences following Hawaii Fi-Do — surfaces accounts that may warrant outreach based on audience size alone

## High Follower Count Prospects

### 1. Leila Byram

**Handle**: @leilahurst

#### Profile
- **Followers**: 69,900
- **Category**: influencer
- **Hawaii-Based**: No
- **Bio**: Athlete
- **Also In Tier**: Tier 3

#### Notes
Large following but no evident HI/service dog/nonprofit connection. Pure audience size play — one post reaches nearly 70K people. If she has any personal connection to service dogs or Hawaii nonprofits, a single story mention could be transformational.

### 2. HUMPHREY

**Handle**: @humphreysaccaro

#### Profile
- **Followers**: 64,300
- **Category**: business_local (hospitality)
- **Hawaii-Based**: Yes
- **Website**: linktr.ee/humphreysaccaro
- **Bio**: Honolulu, Hawaii — Mommy's boy @sammmysaccaro — Professional rock diver
- **Also In Tier**: --

#### Notes
Honolulu celebrity dog (French Bulldog) with 64K+ followers. Miscategorized as hospitality business — this is a personal pet influencer account. Excluded from Tier 1 (not a business entity). However, owner @sammmysaccaro has brand partnerships (Dr. Harvey's) and could promote Hawaii Fi-Do to an enormous, engaged pet-lover audience. Promotional value far exceeds any direct donation ask.

#### Profile

- **Category**: influencer
- **Hawaii-Based**: No

- **Bio**: Originally the account of #EMtheOG; expanded to include our whole family at #emersondogs! Creator of Stay Golden merch
- **Also In Tier**: --

#### Notes
Large dog account but mainland-based, no fundraising path. Golden retriever family with merchandise line. No Hawaii connection. Promotional collab is theoretically possible but geographic disconnect limits fundraising value.

- **Hawaii-Based**: No

- **Also In Tier**: Tier 3

#### Notes
Appeared on KHON2, HI NOW, HNN — strong Hawaii media amplifier. Despite is_hawaii=0 flag, her Hawaii media appearances make her a high-value Tier 3 prospect. Her media connections are the real asset — one TV segment reaches far more than 43K Instagram followers.

#### Notes
Top venue partner with donor-class member network. Creative co-working hub in Kakaako with retail, cafe, clay studio, and event space. Subcategory "school" is a misnomer — this is a creative community space. Their vendor and workshop networks include local business owners, artists, and entrepreneurs. High-value Tier 2 prospect for event hosting and network access.

#### Notes
Top fundraising prospect with venue and sponsorship potential. Honolulu craft brewery and restaurant with event space. Co-founder @chrissiepinney already follows Hawaii Fi-Do. Dual approach: corporate sponsorship from the brewery + personal ask through the co-founder. Venue hosting for fundraiser events adds significant in-kind value.
