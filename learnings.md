## Batch 1 Learnings (2026-02-09)

- Batch 1 had 75 candidates sorted by follower count (69.9K to 2.5K). 44/75 (59%) were excluded.
- Most common exclusion: EXCLUDE_pet_micro (dog influencer accounts) and EXCLUDE_personal (no business signals).
- High-follower accounts are mostly personal/pet accounts — the best fundraising prospects have moderate followers (2K-35K).
- Hawaiian Electric is the calibration anchor at score 95 — major utility is the gold standard.
- Honda Windward (auto dealer) scored 76 despite empty bio — brand name alone reveals established business.
- Pig and the Lady co-owner (@jabbalikespho) was listed as a personal blog but is actually a nationally recognized restaurant owner — always check for business co-ownership mentions in bios.
- Several nonprofits and competitors correctly excluded: Oahu SPCA, Assistance Dogs of Hawaii, Never Quit Dreaming, K9 Kokua, AUW, WOCunite, Shinnyo Lantern Floating, Waikiki Community Center.
- Pet businesses with physical locations (The Public Pet, Hawaii Doggie Bakery, Furever Friends, Tails of Hawaii) qualify as established/small businesses under the exception rule.
- Government officials (Councilmember Augie Tulba) are valuable as door-openers, not direct donors.
- Media/event orgs (Sony Open, Great Aloha Run) are best as door-openers to their sponsor networks.
