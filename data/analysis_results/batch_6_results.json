EFMP at Marine Corps Base Hawaii serves exactly the families who need service dogs - military members with physical, emotional, and developmental special needs.

This is a strategic gateway to the military community in Hawaii and could lead to DoD-level support and funding. Contact the EFMP coordinator to schedule a presentation."
