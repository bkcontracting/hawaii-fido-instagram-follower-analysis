Route 99 Hawaii Wholesale via Faire Route 99 Hawaii Wholesale via Faire Route 99 is the road the connects the world to the North Shore of O\u2019ahu, where our brand was born. We started at the Hale\u2019iwa Farmers Market along, with only two designs in our booth. Since then, we\u2019ve evolved organically \u2014 in part by listening to our loyal and local customers & vendors who continue to ask us for new designs. Our North Shore-inspired designs are embroidered out of our Waialua Home Shop. \n\nIn 2021, we opened up a retail shop -- located in a 40-foot-long shipping container -- in Kahuku, on the North Shore of O'ahu. Each and every one of our FAIRE products are TOP sellers for us. We are a small business, like you, and stand behind our hats selling well for you! That's our commitment to you.

Safety is ensured by clipping the dogs harness to the slatmill so that they don't fall off and dogs are continuously monitored by our expert coach. \r\n \n \n \n \n \n Convenient We come to you! This makes exercising your dog easier than ever. As long as there is a parking space"

We are deeply grateful for your kindness and support of our all-volunteer animal welfare group. \n\n \u00a0 \n\n Your donation provides essential assistance to CSHAF where our volunteers work in coordination with other small local rescues, fosters, and shelter organizations to facilitate in the adoption of companion animals. Many of these animals require special care after suffering abuse, neglect, or displacement before finally arriving at their Forever Homes. It is our utmost wish to help ease this process for the organizations and pets alike, and work towards a building a community where all animals may have a chance at life. Your contribution allows the CSHAF to continue its work to help unite more pets with their future families, and to control animal population through public"
