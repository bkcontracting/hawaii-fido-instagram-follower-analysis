Route 99 Hawaii Wholesale via Faire Route 99 Hawaii Wholesale via Faire Route 99 is the road the connects the world to the North Shore of O\u2019ahu, where our brand was born. We started at the Hale\u2019iwa Farmers Market along, with only two designs in our booth. Since then, we\u2019ve evolved organically \u2014 in part by listening to our loyal and local customers & vendors who continue to ask us for new designs. Our North Shore-inspired designs are embroidered out of our Waialua Home Shop. \n\nIn 2021, we opened up a retail shop -- located in a 40-foot-long shipping container -- in Kahuku, on the North Shore of O'ahu. Each and every one of our FAIRE products are TOP sellers for us. We are a small business, like you, and stand behind our hats selling well for you! That's our commitment to you.
